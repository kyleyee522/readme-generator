# README Generator

## Description

- This repo assists users in creating a README.md file. When a user executes the program, they will be given prompts about what they want their "Project Title" to be, their "Project Descritpion", their "Project Installation Guide", etc. The last two prompts will ask the user to enter their GitHub username and their email, and when the README file is created, they will end up as links. Additionally, a "Table of Contents" will be created and are linked to their corresponding section of the README.

* This project was created to familarize myself with using Node.js and installing NPM packages. Specifically for this project, the "inquirer" and "fs" npm packages were used.
